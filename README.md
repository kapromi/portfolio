# Software Tester Portfolio 
## About me :woman_technologist:
My name is **Karolina** and I have always been eager to learn new things. Throughout my professional career I have had the opportunity to learn and work on many systems. Being a power/key user of ERP systems like MS AX and SAP I actively participated in the implementation of new functionalities and took my first steps in testing (UAT). 

Participation in Dare IT QA Challenge confirmed that this is the right direction of development for me, because just I feel the flow with it. I have been working as a Software Tester for over a year and I have been constantly learning by myself and on additional courses. I have successfully completed the Dare IT Mentoring Program where I extended my knowledge with experienced Mentor.

More details about my path career you can find on [**my LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolina-prominska/).

After work, I climb, run, take pictures, dance with combat fans, play board games and sudoku. I love mountains :heart: [**My passion in 1 minute.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Qt4NMJQAOEtbhlqlQqwHNQEt2YwHD6w/view?usp=sharing)
