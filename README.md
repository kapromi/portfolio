# Software Tester Portfolio 
## About me :woman_technologist:
My name is **Karolina Promińska** and I have always liked to learn new things. Throughout my professional career I have had the opportunity to learn and work on many systems. Being a power/key user of ERP systems like MS AX and SAP I actively participated in the implementation of new functionalities and took my first steps in testing (UAT). 

Participation in Dare IT QA Challenge confirmed that this is the right direction of development for me, because just I feel the flow with it. Over the last year I have been constantly learing by myself and on additional courses. I also work part-time as a software tester and extend my knowledge by testing and developing web application for a Client from medical industry. Since November 2023 I have been improving my testing skills with experienced Mentor in Dare IT Mentoring Program.

More details about my path career you can find on [**my LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolina-prominska/).

After work, I climb, run, take pictures, dance, play board games and sudoku. I love mountains :heart: [**My passion in 1 minute.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Qt4NMJQAOEtbhlqlQqwHNQEt2YwHD6w/view?usp=sharing)
